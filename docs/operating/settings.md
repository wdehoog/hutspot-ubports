## Settings
The Settings page allows to configure:

  * Should Hutspot ask for confirmation before an item is to be un-saved/followed
  * Should Spotify replace tracks in Playlists that cannot be played due to regional restrictions.
  * Use external Browser or a internal Webview to login at Spotify.
  * The number of Search History Items to save. 
  * The maximum number of results to be returned per request. Spotify seems to have a maximum of 50.
  * Should Hutspot prevent the phone from suspending while playing music.
