### Spotify Player on your UBports phone
One option is to install [spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd/releases) on your phone. For example I use 0.2.19 from  spotifyd-2019-10-06-armv6-slim.zip on by opo. 

This version does not have the pulseaudio backend. It will still work but you will have to take care of setting an environment variable in order for the volume controls to work:

```
#!/bin/sh

export PULSE_PROP='media.role=multimedia'
./spotifyd
```

The easiest way to set it up is creating a config file as described in the [README from spotifyd](https://github.com/Spotifyd/spotifyd).


Another problem is the audio getting choppy due to the phone being suspended when the display goes dark. Currently this is solved using a DBus call to `powerd` (requestSysState) by Hutspot when it is playing a track. If Hutspot crashes or quits it might not have notified `powerd` but powerd takes care of that (says [wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/powerd).
