# Hutspot

A simple Spotify Controller for UBports.

One more time: No this is *NOT* a player, it's a controller. It is based on [Hutspot for SailfishOS](https://github.com/sailfish-spotify/hutspot). It uses Spotify web-api and needs a Premium Account.


Read the docs at [https://wdehoog.github.io/hutspot-ubports/](https://wdehoog.github.io/hutspot-ubports/) for what it can and cannot do.
